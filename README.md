# crochet-stitch-counter

Hello Everyone! This is my first ever web dev project that I did in my 2nd Year of my CS Degree. As an avid crocheter who struggles to keep up with my stitch counts, I got an idea to make something  like a stitch counter website to track my stitches. 
This is a pretty straightforward website, not complicated. Just for fun and to strengthen my web dev skills!
